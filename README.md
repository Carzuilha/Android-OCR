# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Android

This project shows an example of the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library, provided by the Google. The original source codes are available on https://developers.google.com/vision/.

## Utilized Materials

 - **Android Studio IDE**, available on https://developer.android.com/studio/.

## Note

This source-code is based on the original Camera library for Android, which is currently deprecated -- the recent versions of Android are using the Camera2 library. But, since there is no OCR library (powered by Google) based on the Camera2 library yet, this source can be used without any problems.
